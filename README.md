Hello â€” I'm **Ali Almusleh**, a dentist turned pentester-in-training.  
This repository contains organized labs, scripts, notes, and tools for web & network penetration testing and OSCP preparation.

## Structure overview
- `Web-Pentesting/` - Web-focused scripts, notes, and vulnerable labs.
- `Network-Pentesting/` - Network enumeration & exploitation scripts, notes, labs.
- `OSCP-Preparation/` - Cheat sheets, custom tools, and writeups for OSCP.
- `Automation/` - Reusable Python and Bash automation scripts.

## How to use

2. Explore folders and READMEs for each area.
3. Add your scripts and writeups, keep commits focused and atomic.

If you want, I can:
- Generate a polished `README.md` for each subfolder.
- Create Git commits and push (you'll need to run commands locally / provide a PAT).
- Convert this structure into multiple separate repos later.
